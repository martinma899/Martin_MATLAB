Jerry: Daryl! Finally someone I can trust!
Daryl: What seems to be the problem Jerry? 
Jerry: I think Bill and Phillip are going to discover why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch and then tell the australian government!
Daryl: Ripper! I always knew those two could do it!
Jerry: ...What? You knew? Are you a secret agent too??
Daryl: You've got that right mate! Heck, most of the office is. That's why we've got a barbie planned this weekend. And why we're all bringing prawns. At this point we've got at least half the office on our side. We have no need to hide.
Jerry: I have to tell someone! I have to-
Daryl: No you don't Jerry. See, everything will be all right. Look at this ripper webpage I've got pulled up. It'll convince you.
Jerry: What do you mean? It's just flashing... lights...
Daryl: See what I mean Jerry? Welp, I've got to go. Ill see you at the barbie!
Jerry: Yeah, I'll see you there mate!
