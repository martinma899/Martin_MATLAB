Jerry: Phillip, I've got to tell you, I think Bill is up to something.
Phillip: Now why would you say that Jerry?
Jerry: Well, he seems quite... australian.
Phillip: Jerry that's one heck of an accusation to be throwing around. 
Jerry: He said things! Like "ripper" and "prawn!"
Phillip: Jerry, "ripper", "prawn", and "barbie" are all completely normal things to say.
Jerry: But then he took me into a utility closet and tried to pay me to betray my country!
Phillip: Haven't we all had bad days though Jerry?
Jerry: I guess... wait, how did you know he said "barbie?" I never said he said that. 
Phillip: Oh no worries Jerry, I was just remembering that we've got that ripper barbie coming up this weekend!
Jerry: Alright Phillip, well I guess I'll see you there...
