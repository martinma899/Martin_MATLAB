Chicken Little: "Hey Big, what's up with duck these days?"
Chicken Big: "I don't know. That duck is out of whack!"
Chicken Little: "Yea, why does duck keep chasing after us?"
Chicken Big: "Beats me. It's like he thinks a duck can rule the streets."
Chicken Little: "Yea. Well, what if we went to the other side?"
Chicken Big: "The other side? Isn't that the side with the cute girl?"
Chicken Little: "Yea, that's the one. Hey, who's this guy?"
Jokester: "Why did the chicken cross the road?"
Chicken Big: "Yea, who're you, Jokester?"
