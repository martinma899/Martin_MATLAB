Chicken 1: "Hey Number 2, what's up?"
Chicken 2: "Not much Number 1. How's your side of the room over there?"
Chicken 1: "Feels kinda warm. Hey, Number 3, think you could turn the AC up on this side?"
Chicken 3: "You guys are the worst. It's always freezing in here!"
Chicken 1: "Oh, put on a sweatshirt and stop acting like a girl."
Chicken 2: "Yea, Number 3. Maybe you should grow more hair like a duck."
Chicken 1: "Haha. Yea, like a duck!"
Chicken 3: "You guys better back off and stay on your own side."
Chicken 2: "Yea, the side without a duck!"
Chicken 1: "Yea, take that Number 3!"
Jokester: "Why did the chicken cross the road?"
Chicken 1, 2, 3: "Where'd you come from, Jokester??"
