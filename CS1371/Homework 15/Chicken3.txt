Chicken Boss: "All right, what's going on around here?"
Chicken Worker: "Uhh...nothing sir! Just work, work, work, that's all!"
Chicken Boss: "I don't believe it. Have you been seeing the girl from the 4th floor again?"
Chicken Worker: "No, no, no. I have not been seeing the girl from the 4th floor again."
Chicken Boss: "Have you been seeing the girl from the 3rd floor, then?"
Chicken Worker: "No, boss! I haven't been seeing a girl from any floor!"
Chicken Boss: "Then why are there phone numbers on that side of your desk right there?"
Chicken Worker: "I don't know! Must've been a prank by that duck again!"
Chicken Boss: "The duck from the other side of the office?"
Chicken Worker: "Yea! The one that's a girl...on the 3rd floor..."
Chicken Boss: "Wait a minute..."
Jokester: "Why did the chicken cross the road?"
Chicken Worker: "*Gulp*...can I show you my report now, boss?"
